Hello! I am Qiaoqiao Ren. I am currently pursuing a PhD at Ghent University, where I specialize in multimodal communication for human-robot interaction. My work primarily focuses on integrating touch and sound to enhance interactions and emotional communication between humans and robots. I am also exploring using LLMs to generate affective haptic data. 

From December 2021, I am supervised in my research by Prof. Tony Belpaeme and Prof. Francis wyffels. I am a part of the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics team within IDLab at Ghent University.

Previously, I completed my Master’s degree with first-class honours in Mechanical Engineering Design at the University of Manchester in the UK. My thesis involved the design and simulation of actuation systems that allow researchers to remotely control the pitch angles of supporting systems in supersonic wind tunnels.

If you're interested in my work or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to get in touch via email at qiaoqiao[dot]ren[at]ugent[dot]be, or through any other contact methods I have listed below.
